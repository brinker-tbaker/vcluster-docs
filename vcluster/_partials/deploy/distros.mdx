vCluster is deployed with its own Kubernetes distribution that does not need to match with the host cluster's distribution. For example, you can deploy virtual clusters with the k8s distro on top of EKS clusters. 


:::warning
After deploying your vCluster, changing the Kubernetes distribution of vCluster is not supported.
:::

By default, the distribution of vCluster is vanilla Kubernetes (k8s) and is the recommended distribution to use. 

There are 2 other options of distributions for vCluster. 

* [k3s](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s) is a highly available, certified Kubernetes distribution designed for production workloads in unattended, resource-constrained, remote locations or inside IoT appliances.
* [k0s](https://github.com/k0sproject/k0s) is an all-inclusive Kubernetes distribution, which is configured with all of the features needed to build a Kubernetes cluster and packaged as a single binary for ease of use. Please note that dual stack networking is not supported with k0s, you will be able to deploy it on a dual stack host cluster, but it will not have all the dual stack features.
